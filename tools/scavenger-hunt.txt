Working on a Mac

(1) My computer's IP address for its current Internet connection in 137.22.164.140 which I found by typing 'ifconfig' into my MacOS terminal. The ethernet IP address is structured with semicolons as opposed to a Wifi connection IP address that's structured with periods.

(2) ping [hostname, example: carleton.edu]

(3) nslookup [IP address]

(4) scp /Desktop/path/to/file username@host/server:/path/to/file (This is for Kali)

(5) lsof -i 4tcp:[port] -sTCP:LISTEN -Fp

(6) sudo lsof -iTcp -sTCP:LISTEN -P -n

(7) curl -O [url]

(8) curl -v [url]

(9) curl -I [url]
