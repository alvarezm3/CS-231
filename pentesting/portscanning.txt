When doing nslookup and whois on the ip instead of the domain name we get more information about the abuse manager and some more contact information. We learned the identity of the technical contact and the administrative contact, their name is Chris Dlugosz

========= LOCAL NETWORK==========
10.0.2.15
We found four hosts.
-10.0.2.2
-10.0.2.3
-10.0.2.4
-10.0.2.15
Nmap also told us that we scanned 256 IP addresses in 2.74 seconds.

These IP addresses represent an entity connected to the local network such as a device, router, printer, etc.

For each IP address, Kali initiated the connection with a TCP handshake. The Kali sends a query through a DNS packet in order to gather information about the host. An external source sends a packet labeled “Who has [IP ADDRESS]? Tell 10.0.2.15” which gets a response of “[IP ADDRESS] is at [MAC ADDRESS]” from another external source.

The session on the remote network had 40 hosts total compared to the 4 hosts found on the local network. The remote network had a lot of TCP packets followed by a lot of DNS packets. Although the remote network capture had more hosts the total time was faster than the local network capture going from 2.74s to 1.96s. Both capture sessions scanned 256.

These IP addresses represent an entity connected to the remote network such as a device, router, printer, software, etc.

For each IP address, Kali sends a TCP handshake to establish connection and then sends a query ‘IN’ through a DNS packet.
